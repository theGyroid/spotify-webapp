# spotify-webapp
This is my poor attempt to build a custom webapp to connect to the spotify API, making use of Vue for the page. Don't expect anything in here to work...
(I didn't expect this repo to get added to the collective repository wiki, but since it is here now then I'm going to try and make it so other people could use it as a starting point)

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Calls `npm run serve` because I always type `npm run dev` out of habit
```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
